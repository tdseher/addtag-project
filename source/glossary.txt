  Term        Definition
  RGN         RNA-guided nuclease, like Cas9, Cas3, and Cpf1.
  dDNA        Donor DNA. The DNA that is knocked-in using endogenous cellular
              homologous recombination machinery.
  gDNA        Genomic DNA.
  HDR         Homology-Directed Repair, a DNA repair mechanism that uses a
              template to repair nicks or double-stranded breaks.
  PAM         The Protospacer Adjacent Motif is a short nucleotide sequence that
              serves as a binding signal for Cas9, and its presence is a strict
              requirement for Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage. Must be at 3' end for
              Cas9, and 5' end for Cpf1. The PAM sequence is on the genomic DNA,
              not the gRNA.
  spacer      The ~20 nt element that is homologous to the region of your
              feature of interest, and will direct Cas9 nuclease activity.
              The portion of the crRNA (or sgRNA) that is complementary to the
              genomic DNA target sequence ~20 nt.
  scaffold    The sequence within the gRNA that is responsible for Cas9 binding.
              Does not include the 20 nt spacer/targeting sequence that is used
              to guide Cas9 to target DNA.
  target      The ~20 nt genomic sequence that precedes the PAM sequence.
  protospacer Short genomic DNA sequences ~20 nt of foreign DNA separated by a
              short palindromic repeat and kept like a record against future
              encounters.
  pre-crRNA   CRISPR array of protospacers is transcribed into pre-crRNA.
  crRNA       pre-crRNA is processed (cut up) to produce a set of crRNAs.
              CRISPR-targeting RNA that contains both the ~20 base spacer
              element and additional nucleotides which are complementary to
              the tracrRNA. crRNA is variable.
  tracrRNA    Hybridizes to the crRNA and binds to the CAS9 protein activating
              the complex to creating double-stranded breaks at specific sites
              within genomic sequence.
              Trans-activating crRNA (which serves as the Cas9 nuclease-
              recruiting sequence?) that has sequence complementary to the
              palindromic repeat. When the tracrRNA hybridizes to the short
              palindromic repeat, it triggers processing by the bacterial
              double-stranded RNA-specific ribonuclease, RNase III. Any crRNA
              and the tracrRNA can then both bind to the Cas9 nuclease, which
              then becomes activated and specific to the DNA sequence
              complimentary to the crRNA. tracrRNA is invariable, and is
              specific to each Cas9 protein.
  gRNA        Guide RNA is a single molecule with two regions: the spacer and
              the scaffold. It is a synthetic fusion of the endogenous bacterial
              crRNA and tracrRNA sequences, and provides both targeting
              specificity and scaffolding/binding ability for Cas9 nuclease.
              Does not exist in nature. Also referred to as sgRNA.
  sgRNA       Synthetic guide RNA, or single guide RNA (synonymous with 'gRNA').
              Combines the tracrRNA and crRNA, which are separate molecules,
              into a single RNA construct, simplifying the components needed to
              use CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing (for plasmid or IVT
              expression). A linker loop sequence is included between the two.
  Cas         CRISPR-associated family of genes, which typically couple
              a nuclease, helicase, or polymerase domain with a 
              poly-nucleotide binding domain.
  Cas9        Cas9 family nucleases.
  eCas9       Any engineered Cas9 variant. Usually non-synonymous substitutions
              are placed at one or more residues predicted to interact with the
              non-target DNA strand.
                For instance, SpCas9-HF1 (high-fidelity variant 1) has alanine
                substitutions at four residues in SpCas9, identified from
                crystal structures, in order to disrupt non-specific contacts
                with the phosphate backbone of the target DNA strand (which
                interacts with the gRNA).
  dCas9       Catalytically 'dead' Cas9 protein, that drive RNA-DNA
              hybridization but fail to cleave the target DNA.
  FokI-dCas9  dCas9 fused with the dimerization-dependent FokI nuclease domain:
              creates a dimeric RNA-guided FokI-dCas9 nuclease (RFN)
              architecture requiring recognition of extended double-length
              target sites for efficient cleavage. Amino-terminal fusions of
              FokI to dCas9 can recognize two 20-nucleotide 'half-sites' in a
              'PAM-out' orientation separated by a 13-18 bp spacer and can
              efficiently cleave in this intervening region.
  Cas9n       Engineered variants of Cas9 in which one of the two nuclease
              domains has been catalytically inactivated, which results in the
              nicking of only one DNA strand and leaving the other strand
              intact. Another strategy proposed to reduce off-target effects
              is to use paired Cas9 nickases (Cas9n), mutated versions of Cas9
              in which one of the two nuclease domains (RuvC or HNH) has been
              catalytically inactivated (for example, by introduction of a
              D10A or H840A mutation). Paired nickases can be directed by two
              gRNAs targeted to neighbouring sites to create offset nicks that
              can induce indel mutations.
  Cpf1        Cpf1 family nucleases.

  St          Streptococcus thermophilus.
  Sm          Streptococcus mutans.
  Sa          Staphylococcus aureus.
  Nm          Neisseria meningitidis.
